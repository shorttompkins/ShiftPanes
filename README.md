1. Include jQuery
2. Include shiftpanes.js
3. Create a container element that contains sets ("panes") of content each within container elements sharing the same class.
4. In your $(document).ready() function call ShiftPanes('container selector', 'pane selector', [delay], ['easing'])
5. delay = 500ms by default
6. easing = 'swing' by default / (Can use any jqEasing setting if that file is included in your page.)
